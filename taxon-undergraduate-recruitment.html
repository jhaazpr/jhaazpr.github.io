                        Collaborating on Taxon as an Undergraduate Researcher
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                      I am working on a tool called Taxon that helps people who want to use 3D printers, laser cutters, or other digital fabrication machines find that right tool for the job. Taxon is a web application that hosts a database of machines, manufacturing tasks for machines, and rules for machine use that are all encoded as <i>programs</i>.
                      Taxon lets users filter machines and safety check their tasks using these rules of thumb, which are user-defined lightweight program analyzers.
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                      Right now, the Taxon interface is functional but not readily usable. It needs some additional features implemented, more example programs added and tested, and documentation written.
                      This work combines a mix of interesting topics like:
                        <ul>
                            <li>front-end/full-stack web development</li>
                            <li>user interface design</li>
                            <li>human-computer interaction</li>
                            <li>programming languages research</li>
                            <li>digital fabrication machines</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        What Research Would Look like

                    <div class="paragraph">
                      You would be working on the Taxon interface as it is currently exists, building out new features and refactoring old ones. We'd start with small tasks and increase the scale as you become more comfortable with the code base. You would generally have a lot of agency as to what/how you'd implement things as you get the hang of the project's vision, which is useful for future cases where you need to describe a project you worked on (e.g. for a job or grad school applications).
                    </div>
		    <div class="paragraph">
		      I would expect you to devote around 5-10 hours a week towards research tasks, with flexibility allowed for when you have exams, job interviews, etc.
		    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                      You would be paid in either research course credit or possibly be paid an hourly wage if my advisor can handle the costs at the moment.

                      I would expect applicants to have completed CSE 311, 332, and 331 or have equivalent coursework or experience. Having taken CSE 340 or an equivalent course is a definite plus. Applicants do not need prior web programming experience, though some exposure is a plus. I prefer that applicants be interested in research for the sake of doing research, rather than looking to pad their resume.

                        Solving these problems is optional, but recommended if you have time. I recommend using Javascript/Typescript, but you can use any language if you really want. Please include any answer code when you email me.

			<strong>Problem 1: Filtering Machine Plans</strong>

                          Write a function that takes an array of machine plans and returns an array of machine plans containing only machine plans in the input array which contain at least one block whose block type is "deltaBot".
