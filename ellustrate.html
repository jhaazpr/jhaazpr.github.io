          Overview
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          Aesthetic Electronics is a research project that I assisted with in the Hybrid
          Ecologies lab under Professor Eric Paulos. The paper was headed by two graduate
          students collaborating with affiliates at Adobe Research.

          The paper contributes a design tool to allow novice users design aesthetic circuits
          in new mediums, for example, silver ink and planar LEDs on papers. My role in the project
          was testing the design tool on users and processing the resulting quantitative and
          qualitative data.

          As interactive electronics become increasingly intimate and personal, the design of circuitry
          is correspondingly developing a more playful and creative aesthetic. Circuit sketching and design
          is a multidimensional activity which combines the arts, crafts, and engineering broadening participation
          of electronic creation to include makers of diverse backgrounds. In order to support this design
          ecology, we present Ellustrate, a digital design tool that enables the functional and aesthetic
          design of electronic circuits with multiple conductive and dielectric materials. Ellustrate guides
          users through the fabrication and debugging process, easing the task of practical circuit creation
          while supporting designers' aesthetic decisions throughout the circuit authoring workflow. In a
          formal user study, we demonstrate how Ellustrate enables a new electronic design conversation that
          combines electronics, materials, and visual aesthetic concerns.

          My Role
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          The goal of our formal user study was to conduct a usability evaluation of the tool, specifically
          observing how circuit design constraints influence the visual aesthetic and how fabrication assistance
          influences agency. I helped conduct the study and document users' actions.

          Below are the some of the users' final designs, which show show examples of different circuit-drawing
          aesthetics. Part of my work on the paper was coding and characterizing these types of aesthetics to better
          understand how designers navigate the constraints of circuits while maintaining an aesthetic. We coded designs
          into the following categories: a) functionalist, b) mimetic, c) constructive, and d) symbolic.

          Quantitatively, reponses on the Likert scale show that users felt that the tool improved their agency in
          designing circuits.
