                      Aesthetic Electronics is a research project that I assisted with in the Hybrid
                      Ecologies lab under Professor Eric Paulos. The paper was headed by two graduate
                      students collaborating with affiliates at Adobe Research.

                      The paper contributes a design tool to allow novice users design aesthetic circuits
                      in new mediums, for example, silver ink and planar LEDs on papers. My role in the project
                      was testing the design tool on users and processing the resulting quantitative and
                      qualitative data.

                      As interactive electronics become increasingly intimate and personal, the design of circuitry
                      is correspondingly developing a more playful and creative aesthetic. Circuit sketching and design
                      is a multidimensional activity which combines the arts, crafts, and engineering broadening participation
                      of electronic creation to include makers of diverse backgrounds. In order to support this design
                      ecology, we present Ellustrate, a digital design tool that enables the functional and aesthetic
                      design of electronic circuits with multiple conductive and dielectric materials. Ellustrate guides
                      users through the fabrication and debugging process, easing the task of practical circuit creation
                      while supporting designers' aesthetic decisions throughout the circuit authoring workflow. In a
                      formal user study, we demonstrate how Ellustrate enables a new electronic design conversation that
                      combines electronics, materials, and visual aesthetic concerns.

                      The goal of our formal user study was to conduct a usability evaluation of the tool, specifically
                      observing how circuit design constraints influence the visual aesthetic and how fabrication assistance
                      influences agency. I helped conduct the study and document users' actions.

                      Below are the some of the users' final designs, which show show examples of different circuit-drawing
                      aesthetics. Part of my work on the paper was coding and characterizing these types of aesthetics to better
                      understand how designers navigate the constraints of circuits while maintaining an aesthetic. We coded designs
                      into the following categories: a) functionalist, b) mimetic, c) constructive, and d) symbolic.

                      Quantitatively, reponses on the Likert scale show that users felt that the tool improved their agency in
                      designing circuits.
