                      In the paper, we introduce a design tool that translates a user's drawings into printable
                      parts for constructing a custom luminaire. The tool allows users to experiment with different
                      designs and LED colors and placement, and a specialized ray tracer allows the user to
                      vizualize the result in real-time.

                      handling the fabrication of custom lenses, finding the optimal means of mixing
                      silicone light diffusers, and creating a use case for the tool, described below.

                      The tool uses the paper.js vector graphics scripting framework which enables common
                      vector editing operations and backwards compatibility with vector graphics applications.
                      In order to carry over tool-specific data (e.g. annotating vector elements that
                      corresponded to LEDs), we overwrote the SVG data attribute with a JSON string.
                      From an initial SVG design, the tool allows the user to specify two types of
                      elements: elements which block light (hard edge), and elements which allowed light to
                      pass through (soft edge).

                    <div class="paragraph">
                      At a high level, the design tool allows users a single operation: place, remove,
                      and move LED elements in a scene. Otherwise, all interactions with the design
                      take place in an external vector graphics editor in order to leverage user's
                      knowledge of and expertise with existing graphic design tools.

                      In order to support the luminaire design tool, we built a computational
                      design backend for constructing a secondary optics system, or the design
                      of fixtures and elements that alter the distribution of luminous intensity
                      from the light source. Such distributions can diffuse, redirect, or focus
                      light. For instance, a collimating optic on a bike light redirects light
                      rays such that they become parallel to each other, increasing the light's
                      viewability from a distance and maximizing the lumens over a given area
                      of focus - like the pavement in front of the bike. Our work explores the
                      creation of secondary optics to diffuse light over an area.

                      One of the most powerful and useful parts of our system is that it automatically generates all of the necessary files to construct the final luminaire. From the user's perspective, once they have finalized their design, the tool outputs five files 1) the 3D enclosure model, 2) a model to cast or print a diffuser, 3) a 3D reflector model, 4) a PCB board design file, and 5) microcontroller code to control the final LED assembly.

                      shoes the luminous intensity curves of LEDs outfitted with several diffuser types. To obtain the
                      graph, I photographed all different diffusers over an LED, cleaned and applied filters to the
                      resulting images, extracted profile curves from pixel values, applied Gaussian smoothing
                      and plotted them. We see that the components outperform the controls in producing smooth
                      distributions of light.

                      study was to obtain qualitative feedback on how the design tool facilitated luminaire
                      design. We were especially interested in understanding a user's mental model of light,
                      and what new functions and aesthetic choices this new understanding would afford.

                      and only an introduction to this novel way of working with light, users readily
                      generated unique light interactions. A shift in vocabulary reflected this new understanding
                      of the various aesthetic uses of light. We found that simulated light beams afforded deeper
                      and more novel explorations of light.
