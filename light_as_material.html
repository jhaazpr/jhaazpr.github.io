        <section class="text">
          Light as Material is a project that probes the use of light as an interactive medium.
          I worked on this project with Cesar Torres and Molly Nicholas in the Hybrid Ecologies
          Lab lead by Professor Eric Paulos.

          In the paper, we introduce a design tool that translates a user's drawings into printable
          parts for constructing a custom luminaire. The tool allows users to experiment with different
          designs and LED colors and placement, and a specialized ray tracer allows the user to
          vizualize the result in real-time.

        <section class="text">
          My role in the project was assisting in building the front-end and back-end tools,
          handling the fabrication of custom lenses, finding the optimal means of mixing
          silicone light diffusers, and creating a use case for the tool, described below.

          The tool uses the paper.js vector graphics scripting framework which enables common
          vector editing operations and backwards compatibility with vector graphics applications.
          In order to carry over tool-specific data (e.g. annotating vector elements that
          corresponded to LEDs), we overwrote the SVG data attribute with a JSON string.
          From an initial SVG design, the tool allows the user to specify two types of
          elements: elements which block light (hard edge), and elements which allowed light to
          pass through (soft edge).

        <section class="text">
          At a high level, the design tool allows users a single operation: place, remove,
          and move LED elements in a scene. Otherwise, all interactions with the design
          take place in an external vector graphics editor in order to leverage user’s
          knowledge of and expertise with existing graphic design tools.

        <section class="text">
          In order to support the luminaire design tool, we built a computational
          design backend for constructing a secondary optics system, or the design
          of fixtures and elements that alter the distribution of luminous intensity
          from the light source. Such distributions can diffuse, redirect, or focus
          light. For instance, a collimating optic on a bike light redirects light
          rays such that they become parallel to each other, increasing the light’s
          viewability from a distance and maximizing the lumens over a given area
          of focus - like the pavement in front of the bike. Our work explores the
          creation of secondary optics to diffuse light over an area.

          One of the most powerful and useful parts of our system is that it automatically generates all of the necessary files to construct the final luminaire. From the user’s perspective, once they have finalized their design, the tool outputs five files 1) the 3D enclosure model, 2) a model to cast or print a diffuser, 3) a 3D reflector model, 4) a PCB board design file, and 5) microcontroller code to control the final LED assembly.

          I validated the effectiveness of out components with empirical testing. The graph above
          shoes the luminous intensity curves of LEDs outfitted with several diffuser types. To obtain the
          graph, I photographed all different diffusers over an LED, cleaned and applied filters to the
          resulting images, extracted profile curves from pixel values, applied Gaussian smoothing
          and plotted them. We see that the components outperform the controls in producing smooth
          distributions of light.

          Use Case: Harvard Square Model

          As an example of what a custom interactive light display could be, I set out
          to make a luminaire of Harvard Square in Cambridge, MA, starting with a drawing
          of the city plan.

          User Studies and Results
        </section>
        <section class="subimage"><img src="assets/light_as_material/userstudy.jpg"></section>
        <section class="text">
          We invited participants to design their own luminaires. The main goal of the user
          study was to obtain qualitative feedback on how the design tool facilitated luminaire
          design. We were especially interested in understanding a user’s mental model of light,
          and what new functions and aesthetic choices this new understanding would afford.
        </section>
        <section class="text">
          Even in a brief workshop-style experience, with minimal experience with the tool
          and only an introduction to this novel way of working with light, users readily
          generated unique light interactions. A shift in vocabulary reflected this new understanding
          of the various aesthetic uses of light. We found that simulated light beams afforded deeper
          and more novel explorations of light.
