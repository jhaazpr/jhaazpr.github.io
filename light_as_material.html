                    Light as Material is a project that probes the use of light as an interactive medium. I worked on this project with Cesar Torres and Molly Nicholas in the Hybrid Ecologies Lab lead by Professor Eric Paulos.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
In the paper, we introduce a design tool that translates a user's drawings into printable parts for constructing a custom luminaire. The tool allows users to experiment with different designs and LED colors and placement, and a specialized ray tracer allows the user to vizualize the result in real-time.

                    <br/>

My role in the project was assisting in building the front-end and back-end tools, handling the fabrication of custom lenses, finding the optimal means of mixing silicone light diffusers, and creating a use case for the tool, described below.
                <div class="bold">Computational Tool</div>
                The tool uses the paper.js vector graphics scripting framework which enables common vector editing operations and backwards compatibility with vector graphics applications. In order to carry over tool-specific data (e.g. annotating vector elements that corresponded to LEDs), we overwrote the SVG data attribute with a JSON string. From an initial SVG design, the tool allows the user to specify two types of elements: elements which block light (hard edge), and elements which allowed light to pass through (soft edge).
At a high level, the design tool allows users a single operation: place, remove, and move LED elements in a scene. Otherwise, all interactions with the design take place in an external vector graphics editor in order to leverage user’s knowledge of and expertise with existing graphic design tools.
In order to support the luminaire design tool, we built a computational design backend for constructing a secondary optics system, or the design of fixtures and elements that alter the distribution of luminous intensity from the light source. Such distributions can diffuse, redirect, or focus light. For instance, a collimating optic on a bike light redirects light rays such that they become parallel to each other, increasing the light’s viewability from a distance and maximizing the lumens over a given area of focus - like the pavement in front of the bike. Our work explores the creation of secondary optics to diffuse light over an area.
